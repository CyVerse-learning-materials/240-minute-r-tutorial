# Base CyVerse Tutorial Repo

You should copy this repo to build CyVerse Tutorials

## How CyVerse Learning Center documentation is built

Each CyVerse Tutorial or Quickstart has its own [ReadtheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/) page which in turn is built from its own repo (See the template repos at [https://github.com/CyVerse-learning-materials](https://github.com/CyVerse-learning-materials)). Starting from a [ResStructured text file](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html) (index.rst) The documentation is built using [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/1.4.8/), and hosted on a repo configured with GitHub [Webhooks/Services](http://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/webhooks.html). Finally, the site is added to ReadtheDocs. Directions for completing this workflow are below **(See Building a Tutorial from Scratch)**.

## Documentation types

- **Tutorials:** Tutorials teach. Users should be able to follow an example dataset through the steps of a tutorial and gain understanding about what is happening along those steps. These are in-depth guides that usually address a scientific question by covering the major steps of a scientific workflow. A tutorial is ‘successful’ when a user is able to follow the tutorial a second time with their own data and obtain reasonable results.
- **Quick Starts:** These materials are short tutorials that cover the minimal amount of information needed to complete an **operational task** (e.g. uploading data, reformatting a file, etc. ); there is no significant explanation of the science or interpretation of results. QSs highlight available resources, answer common questions (derived from user forum), and refer users to the most appropriate materials.

**Examples:**

- Uploading a file: Quick Start
- Cleaning FastQ reads: Quick Start
- Uploading files to SRA: Could be both
- Assembling a transcriptome: Tutorial

## More complex contributions

### Fixing and/or improving documentation via GitHub

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repo to your GitHub account
2. Make edits directly to the **index.rst** file. Edits may be made to the fork the web interface to your GitHub account or [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) the repo to work on your local computer. For very significant changes (we suggest [making a new branch](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/)). 
3. Commit change; if working from a local copy, push those changes to your fork in Github. 
4. Submit a pull request back to the master repository; you may need to act on feedback before your request is merged. 


## Building a Tutorial from Scratch

If you want to go beyond just creating a markdown file, you will need to install some software. 

**You will need the following software**

1. Python (2.7.9 or later) - This is required for the Sphinx package that will build our documentation:
    - https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. If needed, install pip: 
    - https://packaging.python.org/installing/#install-pip-setuptools-and-wheel
3. Sphinx - This will build our tutorials into HTML and other formats (this uses the Python package installer 'pip' so Python must be installed first); we will also install the theme we need for our documentation
        
        $ pip install sphinx sphinx-autobuild sphinx_rtd_theme
4. RestView - Optional, but makes it easy to preview ReStructured text files [http://rst.ninjs.org/](http://rst.ninjs.org/) or install:

        $ pip install restview 
5. git - We use git to version control our documentation and manage with GitHub
    - https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

**Note:** For your convenience, a markdown version of the template is provided. We'd appreciate if you convert it to ReStructured text, but since the conversion is not perfect, let us know if you need help and we will assist you with the process. 


**You will need the following accounts**

1. GitHub account - Will make it possible to collaborate on the documentation:
    - https://github.com/
    

### Procedure 

1. **Import** (not clone) the CyVerse base tutorial repo following GitHub's directions here: https://help.github.com/articles/importing-a-repository-with-github-importer/
    - The CyVerse base tutorial repo URL is **https://github.com/CyVerse-learning-materials/cyverse_base_quickstart**
    - Name your repo for the name of your quickstart or tutorial, e.g. 
    *'name_quickstart'* or *'name_tutorial'*
2. Edit the **index.rst**. Save images or other files in the appropriate directories.
3. Where possible, we recommend keeping documentation on a single index.rst page.  We will have **only one tutorial or quick start per repo.**
4. Save your work as  *'index.rst'*
5. Edit the *'conf.py'* file to set the project and author information
6. Build the tutorial:

        $ make html
7. Your HTML site will be in the _build directory that has been created (you can preview this in your web browser st this time).
8. Commit your changes and push the tutorial back to GitHub.
9. Notify [Tutorials@CyVerse.org](mailto:Tutorials@CyVerse.org) that your tutorial is ready for inclusion in the main CyVerse documentation repo. We will review and verify the contribution, and add you as a maintainer repo in the CyVerse collection. You should make future edits following the instructions above for 'Fixing and/or improving documentation via GitHub.' Alternatively, you can host your tutorial independently on ReadTheDocs following their [instructions for importing documentation](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#import-your-docs).
